This is a simple task list I made using vanilla JavaScript. This application allows you to:
1. Create a new task.
2. Use a checkbox to finish tasks and line through each task.
3. Edit an exisiting task.
4. Delete an exisiting task.

There is no local session storage used, therefore, when the applicaiton is closed no tasks are saved. 

Purpose: This application was solely made to help me re-learn some aspects of JavaScript. Using DOM manipulation and CSS to style. 

Feel free to use this code and make changes to also help you understand DOM and how things interact with event listeners.
